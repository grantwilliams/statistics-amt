Statistik Rechner

You can use this program for sending your statistics to the Statistik Amt every month.
It will calculate how many people from each country stayed at your hostel and for how many nights,
and send it directly to the Statistik Amt.

Using with MyAllocator:
If you use MyAllocator as your channel manager, you just need to provide your login details and all your bookings
will be downloaded directly from MyAllocator, so that the program can then make the calculations for the
statistics.

Using with Hostel World:
If you do not use a channel manager, only Hostel World, you can provide your login details for you Hostel World
Inbox, and the program will search through your Inbox for relevant bookings. Please note, that this will take
quite a while if you have a lot of bookings for any given month, and there is no way to download all the bookings
directly from the Hostel World Inbox, so the program has to search every booking for the month chosen to determine
which country the guest is from.

Using by Uploading your bookings:
If you use a different channel manager, other than MyAllocator, you can download your bookings yourself from your
channel manager and upload the file into the Statistik Rechner program. You must be able to download all bookings
from your channel manager as a 'csv' file for this to work.
If your channel manager is not listed in the drop down menu in the Statistik Rechner program, please contact me
and I can add it in.
